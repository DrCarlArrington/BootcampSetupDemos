This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

# Simple vectors
# Months of the year
months <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

# Average rainfall/precipitation in NYC during each month
precipitation <- c(3.9, 2.9, 4.1, 3.9, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.1, 4.0, 3.4, 3.8, 3.6)

```
```{r}
# Assign names to a vector
# Assign months to precipitation as names
names(precipitation) <- months

print(precipitation)
```
```{r}
# Access a single member of precipitation by its name
mar_precipitation <- precipitation["Mar"]
print(mar_precipitation)
```
```{r}
# Summary of data
# Display summary data of precipitation
summary(precipitation)
precipitation_summary <- summary(precipitation)
```
```{r}
# Access features of a summary
precipitation_summary["Min."]
precipitation_summary["Mean"]
```
```{r}
# Use pipe operators to express a sequence of operations
# precipitation '%>%' summary()
```
```{r}
# use double brackets to find the individual value
precipitation_summary[["Min."]]
```
```{r}
# Standard deviation
# Display the standard deviation 
sd(precipitation)
```
```{r}
# Round SD to two digits
stdev <- sd(precipitation)
round(stdev, 2)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
